      org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Connection.Active:
      @short_description: Active Connection.

      Objects that implement the Connection.Active interface represent an
      attempt to connect to a network using the details provided by a Connection
      object. The Connection.Active object tracks the life-cycle of the
      connection attempt and if successful indicates whether the connected
      network is the "default" or preferred network for access. NetworkManager
      has the concept of connections, which can be thought of as settings, a
      profile or a configuration that can be applied on a networking device.
      Such settings-connections are exposed as D-Bus object and the
      active-connection expresses this relationship between device and
      settings-connection. At any time a settings-connection can only be
      activated on one device and vice versa. However, during activation and
      deactivation multiple active-connections can reference the same device or
      settings-connection as they are waiting to be activated or to be
      deactivated.
