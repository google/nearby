 * Core Bluetooth advertises data on a “best effort” basis, due to limited space and because there
 * may be multiple apps advertising simultaneously. While in the foreground, your app can use up to
 * 28 bytes of space in the initial advertisement data for any combination of the supported
 * advertising data keys. If no this space remains, there’s an additional 10 bytes of space in the
 * scan response, usable only for the local name (represented by the value of the
 * @c CBAdvertisementDataLocalNameKey key). Note that these sizes don’t include the 2 bytes of
 * header information required for each new data type.
 *
 * Any service UUIDs contained in the value of the @c CBAdvertisementDataServiceUUIDsKey key that
 * don’t fit in the allotted space go to a special “overflow” area. These services are discoverable
 * only by an iOS device explicitly scanning for them.
 *
 * While your app is in the background, the local name isn’t advertised and all service UUIDs are in
 * the overflow area.
 *
 * For details about the format of advertising and response data, see the Bluetooth 4.0
 * specification, Volume 3, Part C, Section 11.
 *
 * @param advertisementData An optional dictionary containing the data you want to advertise. The
