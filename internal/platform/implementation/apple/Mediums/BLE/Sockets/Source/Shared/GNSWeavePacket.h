 * This protocol should be implemented by classes handling Weave BLE packets. The classes should

 * serialized Weave packets.

 *
 * @interface Socket : NSObject<GNSWeavePacketHandler>
 * @end

 *

/**
 * The Weave BLE protocol (go/weave-ble-gatt-transport) has two types of packets: control and data.
 *
 * There are 3 types of control packets:
 *      - connection request (GNSWeaveConnectionRequestPacket);
 *      - connection confirm (GNSWeaveConnectionConfirmPacket);
 *      - error (GNSWeaveErrorPacket).
 *
 * The first two messages are used to establish the Weave BLE logical connection: the central
 * (client) sends a connection request packet and the peripheral replies with a connection confirm
 * request. This first two messages are used to negociate to connection paramenter: protocol version
 * and packet size.
 *
 * After the logical connection is established the peers can exchange arbitrarily large messages
 * that split are into data packets (GNSWeaveDataPacket).
 *
 * All packets have a 3-bit packet counter. This is used to detect packet drops, re-ordering or
 * duplication. There is no recovery strategy, if a peer detects any error it sends an error packet
 * to the other peer and closes the connection.
