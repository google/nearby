/**
 * This class is in charge of the CBPeripheralManager. It owns the list of
 * GNSPeripheralServiceManager to advertise. This class dispatches events received from
 * the CBPeripheralManager.
 *
 *  * To create a GNSPeripheralManager instance:
 * GNSPeripheralManager *peripheralManager =
 *     [[GNSPeripheralManager alloc] initWithAdvertisedName:@"AdvertisedName"
 *                                        restoreIdentifier:@"BLEIdentifier"];
 *
 *  * To create a service:
 * GNSShouldAcceptSocketHandler shouldAcceptSocketHandler = ^(GNSSocket *socket) {
 *   socket.delegate = mySocketDelegate;
 *   return YES;
 * }
 * GNSPeripheralServiceManager *service =
 *     [[GNSPeripheralServiceManager alloc] initWithBleServiceUUID:serviceUUID
 *                                       shouldAcceptSocketHandler:shouldAcceptSocketHandler];
 * [peripheralManager addPeripheralServiceManager:service bleServiceAddedCompletion:handler];
 *
 *
 *  * When a socket is created, |shouldAcceptSocketHandler| is called. If the handler returns YES,
 * the socket delegate should be set, and the socket should be retained. The socket delegate
 * will be called as soon as the socket is connected. If the handler returns NO, the socket
 * should not be used.
 * See GNSSocket documentation to send and receive data.
 *
 * This class is not thread-safe.
