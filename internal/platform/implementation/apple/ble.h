// Note: File language is detected using heuristics. Many Objective-C++ headers are incorrectly
// classified as C++ resulting in invalid linter errors. The use of "NSArray" and other Foundation
// classes like "NSData", "NSDictionary" and "NSUUID" are highly weighted for Objective-C and
// Objective-C++ scores. Oddly, "#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>" does not contribute any points.
// This comment alone should be enough to trick the IDE in to believing this is actually some sort
// of Objective-C file. See: cs/google3/devtools/search/lang/recognize_language_classifiers_data
